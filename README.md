## Pokémon GO Search String Generator Ver 1.1.0

This app lets you create search strings for any Pokémon with specific IVs. Try it here at: https://csimbulan.github.io/searchstring/

To use it, start typing a Pokémon species or number in the text bar. A dropdown menu will appear allowing you to select a species.

The strings will automatically be generated. You can choose the following settings:

## IV Type

### Specific:

Search for Pokémon with this specific set of IVs.

### Range:

Choose a custom range of IVs to search for.

## ATK/DEF/STA IVs

Set the specific IVs you want to search for.

## Levels

Choose a custom range of levels to search for.

## Show Half Lvls

Check this box if you want to include Pokémon with half levels in the search. Note that Pokémon do not spawn with half levels in the wild so this is only for powered up Pokémon.

## First Output Box

This box will show the string used to search for the desired Pokémon with the specified IVs. Note that the search will yield Pokémon that POTENTIALLY have those IVs; the CP and HP value will match. Additional appraisal may be necessary to confirm it does have the desired IVs.

## Trash Strings

This box will show the string used to search for the desired Pokémon but with every IV combination other than the specified one. This is used to search for all of the desired Pokémon that you may want to transfer. For example, you specify that you want to search for a 15/15/15 (ATK/DEF/STA) Pokémon, the first output box will give a string that searches for the 15/15/15 Pokémon, and the trash string will search for everything else. HP is not required in the string because the CP not matching is sufficient information.

### Reset Button

Clears the table and resets all settings to default.
